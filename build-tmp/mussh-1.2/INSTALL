BASH COMPLETION
===============
To enable bash completion for mussh, which supports multiple host completion:

1. Copy the mussh-completion.bash file to your bash completion directory:
   
   # For system-wide installation:
   sudo cp mussh-completion.bash /etc/bash_completion.d/mussh
   
   # Or for user-specific installation:
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
   cp mussh-completion.bash ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/mussh

2. To enable completion in your current shell session:
   
   source mussh-completion.bash

The completion script supports tab-completion for multiple hosts after the -h flag:
   
   mussh -h host1<tab>
   # Shows available hosts to complete host2
   
   mussh -h host1 host2<tab> 
   # Shows available hosts to complete host3
